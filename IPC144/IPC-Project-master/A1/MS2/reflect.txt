1. I can incorporate multiple scanf function into one. For example, using output and  input functions as below:
	
	//C code
	printf("Please enter the contact's first name, middle initial(s) and last name (using comma to seperate): \n");
	scanf(" %30[^,], %7[^,], %35[^\n]", name.firstName, name.middleInitial, name.lastName);
	
	In addtion, we can provide users an array of options that may relate to what users have inputed. Users use arrows key to choose what they really need. 
	Thus uses can type less and more accurate.
	
2.	For C language, it does not have a specific data tpye called "STRING". C use an array of char to reprent a string. The last element of this array is always a
 null terminator, i.e '\0'. So C need an addtional byte to store this null terminator. For example, if a stirng has a maximum size of 20, C allocates 25 byte for actually characters and plusing
 1 for null terminator. Thus the total memory should be ocuupied is 26.
