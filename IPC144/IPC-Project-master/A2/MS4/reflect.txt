3. Briefly explain how the two functions findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone benefit your source code
with respect to overall  maintenance and readability?
In the code, I will use index and telephonenumbers several times,if I use modul of findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone, 
that will become more easy and imple. it makes my code logic more clearly. In the future if I need to change part of code,
I only need to maintenance the function, the whole code relate to the fucntion will correct it, it's very convenience.







what did you learn most from doing Assignment?
I found the modul is very usefull and power,which could sharply save lots time and improve effevtive. Most impresstin is 
%[^\n]is power than %s,which update the function of %s, and you should follow the clearnkeyboard() after scanf.
