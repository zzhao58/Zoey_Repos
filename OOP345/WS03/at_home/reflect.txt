1 The reason for specializing the sum() member fucntion
For the string, we need to special definiton, because we can't plus them together, actually we only 
can concatenate them.
template<>
std::string SummableLVPair<std::string, std::string>::sum(const std::string& label, const std::string& sum) const {
	return (label == this->label) ? sum + " " + this->value : sum;
	}; 
	
	
2 The reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.
For a intger, the initial value is 0, but for a tring the initial value should be "".
template<>
std::string SummableLVPair<std::string, std::string>::initValue = "";



3 The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition.
Becasue the value is not change or effect after a class derived a instance or object, all object 
will chare a same value.
template <typename T, int N>
size_t List<T,N>::num_element = 0u;
