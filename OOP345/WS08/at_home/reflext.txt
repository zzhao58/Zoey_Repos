• The advantage that smart pointer syntax provides.
The advantage of smart pointer is that calls its object's or resource's destructor when it itself is destroyed
so we don't need to consider the memory deallocation.

• List the difference between raw and smart pointer syntax in your solution.
Row pointer : we need to destroyed the point after we create a point through method of "new"
Smart point: we don't need to deal with the memory.
