1 The reason for the difference between the copy and move operations?
The most differences for them is the lifetime of move operations 
the move operator is near the end of lifetime which it must clear after assignment.


2 The dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves?
Rrom the result we can see: Move Constructor  0 seconds
                            Move Assignment   0 seconds
The new object(rvalue) point to the address instead of a object which the speed is more fast



3 The changes you made in upgrading your w2 and Text modules?
Text::Text(Text&& src) {
		stringlines = nullptr;
		*this = std::move(src);			
	}
	
Text& Text::operator=(Text&& src) {
		if (this != &src) {
			delete[] stringlines;
			string_Num = src.string_Num;
			stringlines= src.stringlines;
			src.string_Num = 0;
			src.stringlines = nullptr;
		}
		return *this;
	}
